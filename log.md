# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 1, 2018 (Wed)

**Today's Progress**: Installed MongoDB in the c9 server and learned the language to use basic commands. Defined project to start working coding on.

**Thoughts:** Feeling sluggish, but I believe I'm building foundation. No code to share yet, as I'm still learning the language

**Link to work:**  Nothing today.
