# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 1, 2018 (Wed)

**Today's Progress**: Installed MongoDB in the c9 server and learned the language to use basic commands. Defined project to start working coding on.

**Thoughts:** Feeling sluggish, but I believe I'm building foundation. No code to share yet, as I'm still learning the language

**Link to work:**  Nothing today.


### Day 2: Aug 2, 2018 (Thu)

**Today's Progress**: Cloned my webdevbootcamp on C9 to have a standalone server for my projects. Laid the foundation for the core structure of the "UrgenciApp" website

**Thoughts:** Today I started off slow, reviewing the modules from Colt's course on Udemy. It's crazy how quickly I forgot what I'd built with YelpCamp. But the core site is up, ugly as hell, but I have the canvas to work on.
